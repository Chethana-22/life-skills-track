## Types of Communication
### Question 5
#### When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?
In a scenario where if we are feeling fearful that we are about to be harmed, passive communication may help to defuse the situation and aggressive communication might prevent the problem from getting worse.

### Question 6
#### When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?
Rebuilding communication is even more challenging for people in recovery from addiction. They frequently feel frustrated and irritable and often act aggressively toward others.


### Question 7
#### When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?
We often resort to passive-aggressive communication styles when we feel frustrated, hurt, or unable to express our feelings openly. This can happen in situations of conflict, stress, or when they perceive a power imbalance. Passive-aggressive behaviour, such as sarcasm, gossiping, taunts, or giving the silent treatment, might be used to indirectly express dissatisfaction, avoid confrontation, or gain a sense of control.
